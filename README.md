# A test-driven JS assessment
This repo contains a set of tests that will test your JavaScript skills.

## Requirements
We are testing this on **Node 4.2.4+** Please ensure you have a matching version.

## How to get going
Please fork this repo in github. Then clone to your drive.

    npm install
    npm run setup
    npm start

Once you've cloned the repository, you should change into that folder and run
`npm install` from the terminal. That will ensure all the required software is
available.   
`npm run setup` will install the latest version of browser-sync to
your machine.  
`npm start` will run browser-sync and open a browser session.

You will get a long list of tests that all fail. They fail because these tests
are all accessing functions in the various files in `app/*.js`, all of which are
empty functions. 

**Your task is to fill out the functions in `app/*.js` until
all the tests pass.**

The files in `tests/app/*.js` will serve to help highlight what the code is
trying to do, and much of that will be available from the web-page if you click 
on the failed tests, but you are not meant to bring any changes to any files 
outside `app/*.js`.

Once you're done. Please commit the changes to your repo, and share the link
back to us via email.

Good Luck!
